This is a simple project on Java RMI, it was made during the networks programming course fall semester 2022-2023.
This is the server-side of the project, to run it make sure you create a MySQL database called 'rmi' to user 'rmi' with password 'root', 
or change these cridentials in MySqlConnectionFactory class, also, make sure to add the MySQL JDBC jar file needed to connect to the database, finally, configure the ip-address of this device to a static one, and another static one for the client-side machine. 
The client-side code can be found here: https://github.com/Mo7ammadAbuSafat/ClientSideRMIProject-Java
